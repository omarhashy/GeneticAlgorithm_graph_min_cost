<h1>Problem Statement:</h1>
<p>Omar is gearing up for an exciting trip to a group of slands, a group of n islands connected by various cruise routes, each with its own cost. His goal is to visit k islands during his trip, but he's unsure where to begin.</p>
<p>To optimize his adventure, Omar has developed a program that generates a random map of the islands and their associated costs. Using genetic algorithms, he aims to identify a set of k islands to visit with minimal overall cost.</p>
